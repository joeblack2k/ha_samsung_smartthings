## Thank you note

To all maintainers, hobbyists, reverse-engineers, and bug reporters:

Your commits, issue comments, packet captures, protocol notes, and edge-case tests directly improved stability, fallback behavior, and model coverage in this integration.

This wiki exists to document that shared knowledge and make it easier for the next contributor to build on it.

Thank you for the open-source foundation.
